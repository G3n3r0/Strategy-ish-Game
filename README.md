Strategy-ish Game
=================
A turn-based open world.

##Info
###Setting
The story takes place in a post-apocalyptic world, where there is an amalgamation of science and magic. For example, there are robots, but they are powered through alchemical reactions. The world is filled with free cities, each with its own political system. Outside of the control of the city-states, however, are many bandits and small, familial outposts.

###Main Character
You are a young boy, who is too young to remember the apocalypse. You travel with a small robot you built, who assists you in your travels.
